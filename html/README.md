IMPLEMENTING CRYPTOGRAPHY ALGORITHMS            {#mainpage}
====================================

Documentation for the Algorithms used
------------------------

> Basic implementation of Classical Cipher Algorithms. The aim of the 
> repository is to include implementation of major cipher algorithms
> during the course


1. [PlayFair Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher)
   > The technique encrypts pairs of letters (bigrams or digrams), 
   > instead of single letters as in the simple 
   > substitution cipher and rather more complex VigenÃ¨re cipher systems 
   > then in use. The Playfair is thus significantly harder 
   > to break since the frequency analysis used for simple substitution ciphers does not work with it.

2. [Route Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher#Route_cipher) 
   + Encryption to Cipher text
   
        > The implementation of Route Cipher is similar to a spiral matrix
        > where the key is a matrix written as spiral inwards, starting 
        > from top right.
   
   + Decryption of the Cipher text
  
3. [Row Transposition Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher#Columnar_transposition)
   > + Single Encryption
