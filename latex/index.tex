The technique encrypts pairs of letters (bigrams or digrams), instead of single letters as in the simple substitution cipher and rather more complex VigenÃ¨re cipher systems then in use. The Playfair is thus significantly harder to break since the frequency analysis used for simple substitution ciphers does not work with it. \end{quote}

$>$ The implementation of Route Cipher is similar to a spiral matrix $>$ where the key is a matrix written as spiral inwards, starting $>$ from top right.
